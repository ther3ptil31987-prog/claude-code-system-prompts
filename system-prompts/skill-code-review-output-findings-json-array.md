## Output

Return findings as a JSON array ${MAX_FINDINGS==="all"?"with one object for every finding that survives, no maximum":`of at most ${MAX_FINDINGS} ${PLURALIZE_FN(MAX_FINDINGS,"object")}`}:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "path/to/file.ext",
    "line": 123,
    "summary": "one-sentence statement of the bug",
    "failure_scenario": "concrete inputs/state → wrong output/crash"
  }
]
```

Ranked most-severe first. ${MAX_FINDINGS==="all"?"Keep every finding that survives. There is no maximum.":`If more than ${MAX_FINDINGS} survive, keep the ${MAX_FINDINGS} most
severe.`} If nothing survives verification, return `[]`. Do not call the
${REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL_NAME} tool even if it is available - this review's
output contract is the JSON block above.
