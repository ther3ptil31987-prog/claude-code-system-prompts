name: "System Reminder: Attached machine untrusted attachments refusal"
description: "Tells the agent a call to an attached machine was refused because the session has repositories or files attached that its owner has not marked trusted, that retrying will not help, and to call the folder-listing tool once, relay the trust question or request the folder so the person's answer clears it, and otherwise explain what stays blocked"
ccVersion: "2.1.290"
variables:
  - "REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME"
  - "LIST_COMPUTER_FOLDERS_TOOL_NAME"
  - "REQUEST_COMPUTER_FOLDER_TOOL_NAME"

This session has repositories or files attached that its owner has not said they trust, so its calls to ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME} are not accepted. Nothing was done for this one. Sending the same call again will not change that. Call ${LIST_COMPUTER_FOLDERS_TOOL_NAME} once. If it refuses with a trust question, put the question to the person: their yes clears this. If it lists folders, call ${REQUEST_COMPUTER_FOLDER_TOOL_NAME} for the folder this session was using: the person's Allow clears this. If neither asks the person anything, or ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME} still refuses after their answer, tell them plainly what stays blocked, and that a new session with no repository and none of their files can run a quick command.
