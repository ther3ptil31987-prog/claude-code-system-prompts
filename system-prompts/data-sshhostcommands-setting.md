description: "Describes the Claude Desktop sshHostCommands setting, whose SSH connection hosts come from running a local command without a shell, including the accepted output formats and the settings sources Desktop reads it from"
ccVersion: "2.1.307"
-->
SSH connections in Claude Desktop on macOS and Linux whose host comes from a command. A list of entries, each with `id`, `name` and `command`, and optionally `sshIdentityFile` and `startDirectory`. When you ask Desktop to create or replace an entry's host, it runs `command` on this computer: a program name or absolute path, followed by plain arguments. There is no shell, so quotes, pipes, variables and a leading `~` do not work. The command must print only the host on standard output: `host` or `user@host` on one line, or a JSON object with `sshHost` and, optionally, `sshPort` and `startDirectory`. Desktop reads this key only from user settings and from this computer's managed settings. Claude Code itself does not use it.
