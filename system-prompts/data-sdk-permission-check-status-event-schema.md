@internal A tool call has been waiting on its automatic permission check (the auto-mode classifier) for longer than usual. It lets a host say that the step is being checked, where it would otherwise show a silent pause that looks like a running tool. Most checks answer within about four seconds and send nothing. The wait can include the rest of the model's streaming reply, or a dialog the host is showing about the check: prefer those indicators. Every 'checking' is followed by a 'done' for the same tool_use_id. 'done' does not say whether the call was allowed: the tool's result, permission_denied or a can_use_tool request does. One call can send more than one pair. Display-only and best-effort: a frame can be lost, so also stop showing it at any other frame for this tool_use_id or at the end of the turn. Emitted on the output stream of -p/SDK sessions.
