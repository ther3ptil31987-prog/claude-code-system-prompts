description: "Publish-result tail, shown when same-response editing is enabled, saying the sent files are still on disk so a small known change can be made by sending the Edit calls and the Artifact publish together in one response, with no Read or shell edit"
ccVersion: "2.1.295"

The files you sent are still on disk. For a small, specific change to a file whose text is in this conversation, send the Edit call(s) and an Artifact publish of the same file_path together in one response, with no Read and no shell command that edits the file: these calls run one after another in the order given, so the publish sends the edited file. If an Edit reports that it did not apply, correct it and publish again. If the file's text is no longer in this conversation, or you cannot place the change exactly from the text you have, Read it first.
