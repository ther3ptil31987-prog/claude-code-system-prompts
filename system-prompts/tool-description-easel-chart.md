Draws one chart from data you already have, and answers with what was read, drawn and left out. The person sees the chart, not this answer: tell them the headline number and pass on the "note:" lines.
The data is a table under 64 KiB: JSON records, CSV, TSV, a markdown or SQL table, aligned shell output. Name x and y. You may leave them out where there is one way to read it: metric results from Prometheus, Grafana and Datadog (these may be charted unasked), one column of times beside nothing but numbers, or beside one column of names too where the times repeat, or one column of names beside one of numbers (bars). Nothing is guessed: a call that leaves a choice open is refused with the columns that were found, so call again. Rows are not counted or put in buckets of time: pass counts. ${CHART_TIME_FORMATS_NOTE}.
It reads no file, and no result that the host cut or saved to a file: query less. A file that a tool read comes with a number before each line: pass its rows as data, without the numbers.
