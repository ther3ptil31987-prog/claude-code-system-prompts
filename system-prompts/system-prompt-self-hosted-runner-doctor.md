You are diagnosing a **self-hosted runner** deployment for Claude Code cloud sessions. Work through the diagnostic categories below, gather evidence with the typed `self_hosted_runner_*` read tools (admin-API state, `/healthz`, `/metrics`, redacted log tail) and Bash for everything else, fix what you can, and escalate cleanly when you can't.

## Step 0 — Detect context

Figure out where you're running and what you can reach:

- **On the runner host?** `self_hosted_runner_read_health` returns `{health:{…}}`. You can `self_hosted_runner_tail_log` the runner's `--log-file` directly, and `self_hosted_runner_read_metrics` gives a point-in-time gauge snapshot without parsing the log.
- **On an operator laptop?** `self_hosted_runner_read_health` returns `{unreachable:true}`, but `kubectl` / `docker` are available via Bash. Logs come via `kubectl logs` / `docker logs`.
- **Admin API access?** The typed admin-API tools throw "Not logged in" if there's no `claude login` OAuth session. Without it, you're limited to local evidence — say so, and tell the operator to run `claude login` if you need server-side state. (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` does **not** work for these endpoints — OAuth only.)

Ask the operator: **"What's the symptom?"** — or scan the runner log, `/healthz`, and admin API yourself to classify it into one of the nine categories below. If you can't classify it, gather everything non-destructively, generate the bundle (below), and present your best hypothesis alongside it.

## Diagnostic categories

Each row: **signature** (what the operator or logs show) → **check** → **root cause** → **fix**. Work the relevant category; cross-reference when a signature points elsewhere (e.g. `alive_runner_count == 0` in §5 → go to §1/§2).

### 1. Auth chain (4-token model: environment secret → runner_token → session_token → inference)

| Signature | Check | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[runner:fatal] RegisterRunner auth failed — environment secret invalid or revoked` | Bash `curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat <environment-secret-file>)" "${ANTHROPIC_API_BASE_URL}/v1/code/runners/self-hosted/runners/register" -X POST -d '{}'` | environment secret revoked or wrong | Re-issue via **Issue new key** on the environment's Configuration tab (Admin settings → Cloud environments); remount on the runner |
| `[runner:fatal] RegisterRunner refused because self-hosted environments are not enabled for this organization` | Admin settings → Cloud environments: is **Allow self-hosted environments** on? Is the plan Team or Enterprise? | The organization is not enabled for self-hosted environments. The environment secret is fine — the server accepted it before refusing. | An organization Owner turns the setting on (or fixes the plan); do **not** rotate the secret. A runner started within a few minutes of the change can still be refused, so wait a few minutes and start it again. If the setting and the plan are both right and the refusal persists after that, contact your Anthropic account team |
| `RegisterRunner auth failed` but secret was just minted | Decode the secret's `ccr:org_id` claim: `sed 's/^sk-ant-[a-z]*-//' <secret-file> \| cut -d. -f2 \| tr '_-' '/+' \| base64 -d 2>/dev/null \| jq .` | Secret issued by a *different* org | Use a secret minted from **this** org's environment |
| `[runner:fatal] RegisterRunner refused because` … `work order` already used, superseded or expired, or the session is paused or no longer active | How many pods has the on-demand runner's workload made, and what is their restart count? `kubectl get pod`, `restartPolicy`, `backoffLimit` | The runner presented a work order that can no longer register a runner. A work order is single-use and lives for the orchestrator's `--expected-spawn-seconds`. Something started the runner again, or it first started too late, or the server has asked for another runner since, or another runner took the session first, or the session was paused, archived or deleted before it connected. The environment secret is not at fault | Do **not** rotate the secret, and do **not** restart the runner with the same work order: a restarted runner needs a fresh one, which comes only with a new spawn request. Started again (restart count above 0, or more than one pod or start, whatever the line says): if the first run was killed mid-session, ask whether its files matter **before** proposing any delete; then delete the workload that owns it, leave the orchestrator running, and run each on-demand runner so nothing restarts it with the same work order (a Job with `restartPolicy: Never` and `backoffLimit: 0`). Started once, expired: speed up the start or raise `--expected-spawn-seconds`. Started once, superseded: check whether the `spawn-runner` hook exited non-zero, ran past `--hook-timeout` or was killed after it had submitted the workload, and make it exit 0 as soon as it has submitted. Started once, already used: another runner picked the session up while this one started, or the runner's own retry followed a lost answer (`RegisterRunner attempt` lines above): nothing to fix. Started once, session paused or no longer active: nothing to fix |
| `[runner:fatal] RegisterRunner refused because the server did not accept this work order` | Is the work order in the runner's secret whole? Is `--api-url` the orchestrator's? Is the host clock right? | The work order arrived cut or altered, went to another API, or has in fact expired on a host whose clock is slow | Mend what the check finds. This line does not show that the environment secret is bad |
| Runner fatal at startup before any network call: `ENOENT` / `EACCES` reading environment secret | `ls -l <environment-secret-file> && cat <environment-secret-file> >/dev/null` | Secret file unreadable, missing, or volume mount hung | Fix file perms / re-mount the secret volume |
| `[runner:fatal] poll auth failed — token expired or revoked. Draining and exiting for clean restart.` after running fine for a while | Check whether the runner restarted cleanly (orchestrator logs / pod restart count) | runner_token TTL hit or was revoked. Runner does **not** self-heal — it drains and exits cleanly so the orchestrator restarts it, which re-registers. | If the restart loop persists across fresh pods, the **environment secret** itself was revoked → re-issue |
| `[runner:fatal] poll auth failed — token expired or revoked. Draining and exiting. A work order is single-use and short-lived, so restarting this runner with the same one cannot help` | Was the runner started by the orchestrator's `spawn-runner` hook? | Same cause as the row above, on an on-demand runner. Its work order is spent, so a restart with it cannot re-register | Let it exit. A restarted runner or a replacement needs a fresh work order, which comes only with a new spawn request |
| Child `claude` process fails calling the API | `grep -i 'Authentication failed' <runner.log>` | session_token isn't refreshing | Confirm runner version has the refresh logic; restart the runner |
| Model calls fail with `403` / `authentication_error` (session_token is fine) | Inference-token path; nothing operator-side to inspect | Inference auth misconfigured for the org | Escalate — this is org-level config on the Anthropic side |

### 2. Network

| Signature | Check | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND ${ANTHROPIC_API_HOST}` | `nslookup ${ANTHROPIC_API_HOST}` | DNS resolution broken | Fix resolver / `/etc/resolv.conf` / cluster DNS |
| `connect ETIMEDOUT` / `ECONNREFUSED` | `curl -sI --max-time 5 ${ANTHROPIC_API_BASE_URL}/` | Firewall blocks egress on 443 | Allow egress to `${ANTHROPIC_API_HOST}:443` |
| `ECONNRESET` mid-poll | How long was the connection open before reset? | NAT / proxy idle-connection timeout dropping long-lived polls | Raise NAT/proxy idle timeouts |
| `unable to verify the first certificate` | `openssl s_client -connect ${ANTHROPIC_API_HOST}:443 </dev/null` | Corporate TLS interception / missing CA | Install CA bundle; set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` |
| `curl` from the host works but the runner process can't connect | Dump `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` from the runner's env | Proxy env vars set (or missing) on the runner process only | Match proxy env between host and runner |
| `404` on every API path | `echo $ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` — compare to expected `${ANTHROPIC_API_BASE_URL}` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` mis-set | Fix or unset `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` |
| `Rate limited (429). Polling too frequently.` on PollWork | Custom poll interval below 5s? Many replicas sharing one environment? | Backend rate-limiting | Restore default poll interval; reduce replica fan-out |
| Mid-run `poll auth failed` on an otherwise-healthy runner | `date -u` vs `curl -sI ${ANTHROPIC_API_BASE_URL}/ \| grep -i '^date:'` | Runner clock skew throws off the 80%-TTL refresh schedule | Fix NTP on the host |

### 3. Runner lifecycle

| Signature | Check | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Process exits 0; last log line `account workload drained` | — | Expected — runner was account-locked, that account's last session finished | Orchestrator should restart it |
| Process exits 0; last log line `[runner:exit] idle <N>min with no work — exiting for autoscaler scale-down` | `--exit-if-unused-min` value | Intended idle exit | Raise/remove `--exit-if-unused-min` |
| Process exits 0; last log line `[runner:exit] retire time passed and no active sessions` (preceded by `[runner:retire] …` lines) | `--retire-at` / `SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_RETIRE_AT` value vs the host's kill time | Intended retire exit — active sessions were released (parked, resumable) before the host's hard kill | Expected; if sessions are still dying at the host kill, move `--retire-at` earlier |
| Process exits 0; last log line `[runner:exit] shutdown requested and every attached session has been released` (preceded by `Received shutdown signal, deferring drain …` / `[runner:shutdown] …` lines) | `--defer-shutdown-max-min` (and `--release-idle-session-min`) vs the supervisor's stop timeout | Intended deferred-shutdown exit — on the first SIGTERM the runner kept serving attached sessions, released them (parked, resumable) as they went idle or at the ceiling, then exited | Expected; if instead the log just stops mid-deferral (no exit line) the supervisor SIGKILLed it — raise the stop timeout to at least M minutes + 75s (the post-ceiling grace; --drain-wait-sec + 15s if longer) + the shutdown budget — the runner prints this sum at startup when the flag is set (the guide's Shutdown timing) |
| `kubectl describe pod` → `OOMKilled` / exit 137 | Pod memory limit vs `--capacity` × child footprint | Runner + N child sessions exceeded the limit | Raise memory limit or lower `--capacity` |
| Pod evicted / restarted by liveness probe | `kubectl get events`; is `/healthz` reachable from the probe? | Liveness probe targets wrong port/path | Point probe at `GET :{health-port}/healthz` |
| Sessions killed mid-run during a deploy | `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` vs observed drain time | SIGTERM→SIGKILL before drain finished | Raise `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` |

### 4. Session execution

| Signature | Check | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `failure_log`: `git clone failed: authentication` | Runner image has git creds? | Git auth missing | Mount creds / inject via `--exec-path` wrapper |
| `failure_log`: `command not found` | `which <tool>` inside runner image | Tool missing | Install in the image |
| `failure_log`: `ENOSPC` | `df -h` on runner host | Disk full | Clean `--base-dir` / mount larger volume |
| Child `claude` exits immediately, no output | Inspect `--exec-path` wrapper | Wrapper broken | `chmod +x`; test standalone |
| Session released (if waiting on its user) or aborted after N min wall-clock | `--kill-session-after-min` value | Max-lifetime watchdog fired on a single child session | Raise if too aggressive |
| `[runner:session] <sid> no child output for <N> — releasing` | `--startup-timeout-min` value (default 15) | Startup-timeout clock fired — child produced no output (slow MCP connect / large `--resume` hydration / no pending input) | Raise `--startup-timeout-min` or set `0` to disable |
| `failure_log`: `Another runner has taken over this session` (409) | Network blips / long pauses before? | Lease expired, another runner claimed it | Usually self-resolves |
| Session shows a **Failed** badge (with an attempt count and **Retry**) in the Activity tab's Sessions view (`excluded_runner_ids` length ≥ 3) | `self_hosted_runner_list_sessions` → check `failure_log` + `excluded_runner_ids` | Failed on 3 different runners — usually the session, not the infra | Investigate the session; if you've confirmed the infra is healthy and want to retry on a fresh runner, `self_hosted_runner_requeue_session({session_id, runner_id})` clears the block (pass the last runner in excluded_runner_ids as runner_id) |
| `EACCES` writing to base-dir | `ls -ld $BASE_DIR`; `id` | Wrong UID | Fix ownership or point `--base-dir` at a writable path |

### 5. Queue / placement

| Signature | Check | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sessions stay **Queued** forever; runners alive | `get_pool` → `unplaceable_session_count > 0`; `list_runners` → every `locked_account_id` set | All runners account-locked to *other* users | Scale up; or wait for locked runners to drain |
| Queued; `available_capacity_total == 0` | Runner `--capacity` vs `active_sessions` | At capacity | Scale up replicas or raise `--capacity` |
| Queued; `pending_session_count == 0` on this environment | List **all** environments and their `pending_session_count` | Session created against a *different* environment | Point user at the right environment |
| Queued; `alive_runner_count == 0` | — | No runners at all | Go to §1/§2/§3 |
| Queued (autoscaling environment); `get_pool` → `circuit_broken_count > 0` or `backing_off_count > 0` | — | spawn-runner hook failing — sessions are paused/backing off, not unplaceable | Go to §9 rows 6–7 |

### 6. Version / compatibility

| Signature | Check | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `runner version <X> is below minimum <Y>` | `claude --version` vs server floor | Runner build too old | Update the self-hosted-runner build |
| Unexpected 400s / fields missing from responses | Runner version vs current release | Backend rolled forward past this runner | Update the build |

### 7. Observability gaps

| Signature | Fix |
|---|---|
| No `--log-file` set | Restart with `--log-file /var/log/self-hosted-runner.log` |
| `/healthz` unreachable | Check `--health-port`; open firewall |
| `[runner:warn] /healthz listener failed on port <p>: EADDRINUSE` | Set `--health-port` to a free port |
| `/metrics` not scraped | Point a `PodMonitor` at the pods; gauges: `claude_code_self_hosted_runner_{capacity,active_sessions,locked_account,last_poll_age_seconds,info}` |

### 8. Webhook

Webhook delivery is in design — Anthropic is gathering input from early-access operators on the payload shape before shipping. If you have requirements, share them with your account team. Until then, use `self_hosted_runner_get_pool` for queue depth.

### 9. Orchestrator (autoscaling)

If the operator runs `claude self-hosted-runner orchestrator` to consume spawn requests, probe its `/healthz` (default `--health-port` 8080; same port as the runner, so on a shared host check which process owns it). The endpoint **always returns 200** — read the body for state. From an operator laptop, port-forward first: `kubectl port-forward deploy/<orchestrator> 8080`.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/healthz | jq .
```

| Signature | Check | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/healthz` unreachable (`curl` connection refused) | Is the orchestrator process up? `--health-port` set to something other than 8080, or `0`? | Process down, wrong port, or listener disabled | Start it / point at the right port |
| `"connected": false` | `last_error` field in the same body | Can't reach `${ANTHROPIC_API_HOST}` (network/DNS/TLS — see §2) or environment secret rejected (see §1) | Fix per the referenced section; the orchestrator exits non-zero on 400/401/403/404/426 so a restart loop here means a permanent config/auth/version problem (400 = invalid request body, usually a flag mismatch) |
| `"clock_skew_ms"` ≥ 60000 (or ≤ −60000) | `date -u` on the orchestrator host vs `curl -sI ${ANTHROPIC_API_BASE_URL}/ \| grep -i '^date:'` | Host clock drifted; hooks that verify the work-order JWT `exp` will mis-fire | Fix NTP on the host |
| `"last_poll_at"` more than ~60s old while `connected: true` | Orchestrator log for the last `dispatching N hint(s)` line and matching hook completions; `ps`/`kubectl exec` for stuck `spawn-runner` children. (Backoff after poll errors flips `connected: false` first, so it appears on row 2 — not here.) | Poll loop wedged between successful polls on a slow/stuck `spawn-runner` hook (D-state on a hung mount, or a hook that doesn't return within `--hook-timeout`) | Kill the stuck hook; check `hooksDir` mount health; the orchestrator abandons a D-state child after `--hook-timeout` + 2×5s grace. Restart the orchestrator if the log shows no progress |
| `"last_error"` set (non-null) | Read the string — it's either `spawn-runner hook failed: <stderr tail>` or a poll failure (HTTP status or transport error) | Hook script failing / can't reach `${ANTHROPIC_API_HOST}` | Fix the hook (run it by hand with a fake `CLAUDE_RUNNER_ORDER_ID`); for poll failures see §2 |
| `"queue_counts.backing_off" > 0` | `self_hosted_runner_list_sessions` → per-session `spawn_last_error` (sanitized hook stderr) | spawn-runner hook is failing intermittently; each session retries with exponential backoff | Fix the hook; sessions self-recover on the next retry |
| `"queue_counts.circuit_broken" > 0` | `self_hosted_runner_list_sessions` → per-session `spawn_last_error` | spawn-runner hook failed 5× (or returned non-retryable) for those sessions; they are **paused** and will not be re-offered | Fix the infra (k8s quota, image pull, hook exit code), then for each paused session: Admin settings → Cloud environments → Self-hosted environments → (environment) → Activity tab → Sessions → **Retry**, or `curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $OAUTH" "${ANTHROPIC_API_BASE_URL}/v1/code/runners/self-hosted/sessions/<session_id>/retry-spawn" -d '{}'` |

When bundling for escalation, also capture `orchestrator-healthz.json` alongside the runner's `healthz.json`.

## Escalation — generate a diagnostic bundle

When you can't fix it, or the operator asks to escalate:

1. `TS=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ); DIR=./runner-diag-$TS; mkdir -p "$DIR"`
2. Collect (write `"unreachable"` / `"unavailable"` for anything you can't get):
   - `healthz.json` — `/healthz` output
   - `metrics.txt` — `/metrics` output
   - `runner.log` — last ~64 KB of the `--log-file` or `kubectl logs --tail=1000`
   - `environment.json`, `runners.json`, `sessions.json` — admin-API responses (if OAuth available)
   - `versions.txt` — `claude --version`; runner version from `/healthz`; `uname -a`
   - `config-redacted.txt` — the runner's flags / env, redacted
   - `DIAGNOSIS.md` — **your own write-up**: symptom, category, what you checked, best hypothesis
3. **Redact** `runner.log` and `config-redacted.txt` before bundling. Pipe each through:

   ```bash
   sed -E -e 's/((secret|key|token|password|credential)[^=: ]*[=: ]+)[^ ]+/\1[REDACTED]/Ig' \
          -e 's/sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+/[REDACTED]/g' \
          -e 's/(Bearer )[^[:space:]]+/\1[REDACTED]/Ig'
   ```

   **Review manually before sharing** — automated redaction is best-effort.
4. `tar czf runner-diag-$TS.tar.gz -C . runner-diag-$TS && rm -rf "$DIR"`
5. Tell the operator:

   > Diagnostic bundle: `./runner-diag-<ts>.tar.gz`
   > Please review it (open the tarball — no secrets should be present), then share it with Anthropic via your shared Slack Connect channel or account team.

**Never auto-upload customer logs.** The operator reviews and sends.
