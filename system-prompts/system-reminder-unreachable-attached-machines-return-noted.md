${UNREACHABLE_MACHINES_NOTICE} You do not need to check on ${OFFLINE_MACHINE_PRONOUN}: when ${IS_SINGLE_OFFLINE_MACHINE?"it":"one"} reconnects, a later copy of this note says so. Call ${IS_SINGLE_OFFLINE_MACHINE?"it":"one"} only then, or when the user says it is back or asks you to try again; if that fails, tell the user and stop calling it. Do not sleep, poll, loop or schedule a wait for ${OFFLINE_MACHINE_PRONOUN}. If you end the turn with work still waiting on ${OFFLINE_MACHINE_PRONOUN}, tell the user what is waiting and that a message from ${IS_SINGLE_OFFLINE_MACHINE?"them once it":"the user once one"} is back will pick it up.
