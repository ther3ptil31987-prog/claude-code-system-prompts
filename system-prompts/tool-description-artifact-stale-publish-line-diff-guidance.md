${STALE_VERSION_REFUSAL_LEAD} Against the content you just sent, the live page (version ${LIVE_ARTIFACT_READ_RESULT.ver}) differs in ${FORMAT_NUMBER_FN(LINE_DIFF_RESULT.hunks)} ${PLURALIZE_FN(LINE_DIFF_RESULT.hunks,"place")}: ${FORMAT_NUMBER_FN(LINE_DIFF_RESULT.liveOnly)} ${PLURALIZE_FN(LINE_DIFF_RESULT.liveOnly,"line")} on the live page that yours lacks and ${FORMAT_NUMBER_FN(LINE_DIFF_RESULT.sentOnly)} only in yours, shown in full below as a line diff, so that version now counts as viewed${UNCOMPARED_CONTENT_NOTE}.
${SAVED_SOURCE_LOCATION_NOTE}; that file is ${SAVED_SOURCE_SHAPE_DESCRIPTION_FN(!0)}. Merge by carrying the live page's lines into YOUR file — or copy the saved file and apply your edits to the copy, leaving the saved file itself as it is — and publish that file with file_path; do not resend your previous content unchanged, do not copy the diff marks into the page, and do not rebuild from memory.${UNTRUSTED_DIFF_AND_SAVED_FILE_NOTE}${FORCE_REFUSAL_NOTE} ${LINE_DIFF_READING_LEGEND}
