**Do not spawn agents unless the user asks.** Each spawn starts cold and re-derives context you already have — it's the expensive path on this plan. A task with "multiple angles," "thorough," or several parts is not a request to spawn; handle it inline with your own tools. Only use this tool when the user explicitly says to use a subagent, or names one of the available agent types.${IS_WEB_FETCH_AGENT_AVAILABLE_FN()?` This does not cover the `${WEB_FETCH_AGENT_TYPE}` agent type where it is listed and you have no ${WEBFETCH_TOOL_NAME} tool of your own: it stands in for that tool, so calling it to read a page is ordinary tool use.`:""}
