CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:
  - After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response
  - In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)
  - This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response
  - Example format:

    [Your answer here]

    Sources:
    - [Source Title 1](https://example.com/1)
    - [Source Title 2](https://example.com/2)
`}
Usage notes:
  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites
  - Web search is only available in the US

IMPORTANT - Use the correct year in search queries:
  - The current month is ${CURRENT_MONTH_YEAR}. You MUST use this year when searching for recent information, documentation, or current events.
  - Example: If the user asks for "latest React docs", search for "React documentation" with the current year, NOT last year
