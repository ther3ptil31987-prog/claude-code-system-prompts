is the only way to learn ${IS_SINGLE_OFFLINE_MACHINE?"it is":"they are"} back, so make one only when the user says so or asks you to try again; if that fails, tell the user and stop calling ${OFFLINE_MACHINE_PRONOUN}. Do not sleep, poll, loop or schedule a wait for ${OFFLINE_MACHINE_PRONOUN}; if the user asks you to wait, say you cannot and ask them to tell you when ${IS_SINGLE_OFFLINE_MACHINE?"it is":"they are"} back.
