${STOPPED_ANSWERING_NOTICE} Do not call ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME} again ${ATTACHED_MACHINE_MESSAGE_REGISTRY["away.until"](REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME)}; then check what this command did before repeating it. Meanwhile do the rest of the task without ${REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME}, and tell the user what is blocked and what you could not verify.
