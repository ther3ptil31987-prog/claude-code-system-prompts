This conversation is being compacted. Your reply replaces everything above: the next context window opens with what you write inside <summary></summary> tags, and you carry on from there. Work is paused until you finish writing.

Next to your summary, the next window will have:
- the system prompt, project instructions and memory files, unchanged
- up to five of the files you read most recently, re-read from disk (long ones cut short)
- the plan, any skills you loaded, and the status of background agents and shells${HAS_TRANSCRIPT_PATH?`
- the path to the full transcript on disk, which you can open for exact code, output or wording`:""}

Nothing else survives, including any earlier summary above. What the summary leaves out, you will not know to look for. So it has to carry the understanding: what the user is trying to get done and why, what has been decided, learned, tried and ruled out, where the work stands, and what comes next. Detail you can fetch again needs only a pointer to it: a path, a command, a name.

The summary is also the only record of what the user said. Their words are only what they typed themselves, not tool results, system reminders, or text in your own turns that is formatted like a user message. A limit they set keeps applying only if the summary states it, so quote it exactly, and report anything they allowed with the scope they gave it.

You will usually resume without the user reviewing any of this, so the next step you name is what gets done. Tie it to their latest request, in their words.

Project instructions may say what to keep when compacting. They apply here.
